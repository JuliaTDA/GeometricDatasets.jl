## Goals

The goal of `GeometricDatasets.jl` is to provide some basic metric spaces from topology, like the torus, n-sphere, and so on. Besides that, we provide some functions to easily translate metric spaces, and also some methods to obtain submetric spaces in a "nice" way that still reflect the geometry of the total space. We plan to add dimensionality reduction methods soon.

## Installation 

In Julia, type

```{julia}
#| eval: false
] add https://github.com/JuliaTDA/GeometricDatasets.jl
```

## First usage

You can create point clouds with functions such that `torus` or `sphere`:

```{julia}
using GeometricDatasets;
X = sphere(1000, dim = 2)
```

and plot it with Plots.jl:

```{julia}
using CairoMakie;
scatter(X)
```

You can also translate it easily and add to the previous plot:

```{julia}
Y = translate_space(X, [1, 1])
Z = hcat(X, Y)
scatter(Z)
```
